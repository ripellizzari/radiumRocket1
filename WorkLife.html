          We're constantly taught the recipe for getting ahead is to put our

          This article contains strong language some readers may find offensive

          <p>
            Late this summer, UK author Kate Lister had a realisation that
            resonated. On Twitter, she wrote: “How old were you when you
            realised your original plan of being really nice, working really
            hard, & taking on much more than you should in the hope you would be
            automatically rewarded for this without asking, was totally shit?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Cynical or not, the sentiment resonated: more than 400,000 people
            have liked or retweeted it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite adages and advice that tell people from a young age hard
            work will get you everywhere, it really won’t, says Jeff Shannon, an
            executive coach, and author of Hard Work is Not Enough: The
            Surprising Truth about Being Believable at Work. He believes “hard
            work is a good start”, and early in your career, it can certainly
            help you establish yourself in a job.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it’s not enough to take you all the way to the top. “At a
            certain point you look around and realise, wow, everyone works hard
            at this level. Expertise and hard work just become the expectation,
            and will not help you up the ladder.”
          </p>
          <p>
            So, yes, it’s unfair the system doesn’t simply value hard work flat
            out – but it’s an important reality for workers to grapple with,
            especially if they’re struggling to climb the ladder. To really get
            ahead, you need to be doing more than just your job. Realisations
            like Lister’s often me on the heels of watching colleagues with
            similar (or fewer) abilities soar, while your career tagnates. More
            often than not, those who rise are the ones willing to politick
            their way to the top, while you were too busy just working hard to
            notice you should be working the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hard work, says Shannon, doesn’t much matter if no one recognises
            you’re doing it. To translate that effort into promotions and
            advancement, especially in a changed world of work, you have to make
            people notice it – and you.

          <h4>The ‘tiara effect’ trap</h4>

          <p>
            Hard work is still very important, says Carol Frohlinger, president
            of US-based consulting firm Negotiating Women, Inc. But simply
            waiting for someone to pick up on it is detrimental.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frohlinger calls this tendency the “tiara effect” (a term Sheryl
            Sandberg also cited in Lean In). “People work really hard and
            deliver fabulous results and hope that the right people notice and
            come along and place a tiara on their heads. But that usually
            doesn’t happen,” she says. “One of the things that can happen to
            people who do good work and nothing else is that they’re under the
            radar. So, when there’s an opportunity for promotion, nobody thinks
            of them. They’re just forgotten, in a benign sort of way.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This flies in the face of societal training that begins as early as
            primary school, when students are taught that the quiet, hard
            workers are those most likely to prosper. Because teachers reward
            such qualities in early years, we tend to expect our eventual bosses
            will, too. It’s frustrating, then, to enter the working world only
            to discover this engrained lesson is often incorrect.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, as Shannon notes, hard work alone typically goes unnoticed
            after a certain point, because everyone around you is working at or
            about the same level. If you don’t draw attention to yourself in
            other ways, it’s easy to fade into the background.
          </p>
          <p>
            While both men and women are susceptible to supervisors overlooking
            their hard work, Frohlinger says women are often more negatively
            impacted, because it’s generally seen as more acceptable for men to
            talk about their accomplishments. “For women, it can be seen as
            bragging, and bragging women can be punished,” she says.
          </p>

          <h3>
            To climb the ladder, it’s necessary to be not just a great worker,
            but a bit of a politician
          </h3>

          <p>
            So, how do you get around the stereotype? The answer – for men as
            well as women – is to find a way to draw attention to your
            endeavours without waiting for something as infrequent as a yearly
            review or performance self-assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What happens in a lot of companies and organisations is that you
            wait until the very end of the year, when you do the ‘I love me’
            [self-assessment] memo,” says Frohlinger. “But you just can’t wait a
            year.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She suggests giving the boss more frequent, albeit succinct,
            updates, and being sure to put accomplishments in context. “It could
            be just a quick email with some bullet points: here are my wins, and
            here’s what they did for us,” she says. “Here’s why it was helpful
            for our team, or how it saved the company money.” Frequency and word
            choice matter, adds Frohlinger. “Nobody wants to hear it every day.
            Using phrases like ‘my team and I’ helps you make yourself look good
            while also sharing the kudos.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Framing is important, too. A boss may find it odd to get an
            unsolicited update singing your own praises, but it’ll go over
            better cast as a check-in or a way to “keep them in the loop”, says
            Frohlinger.
          </p>

          <h4>The value of politics</h4>

          <p>
            Yet in most offices and industries, proven ability alone isn’t
            enough to help you get ahead, because you also need to be likeable
            and memorable. “If you want to have impact and influence, people
            need to trust and believe in you,” says Shannon, the same way they
            do a candidate they support.

          <p>
            Basically, to climb the ladder, it’s necessary to be not just a
            great worker, but a bit of a politician.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You need to be seen as a leader,” says Frohlinger. “You need to be
            liked: by people at your level, by people above you and by people
            below you. When you evaluate work, the research is quite clear –
            <a
              href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jbecon/v91y2021i1d10.1007_s11573-020-00976-0.html"
            >
              people who are liked get better ratings</a
            >, even if their work is the same.” And therein lies the unfair
            truth: you and a colleague may have the exact same skills and work
            ethic, but if they’ve spent more time making friends and influencing
            people, they’ll look better at their job. Bosses are human, too, and
            it’s simply a basic instinct for them to favour people they like.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is very possible to increase your political capital at
            work. There are basic tactics that can make you a well-liked member
            of the office, simply by paying attention to your colleagues. “You
            need to think about how to connect with people other than just on
            the work,” says Frohlinger. “Do we have a shared hobby or interest?
            Let’s say I know you like gardening, and I see this gardening
            article and I send it to you. That’s pretty simple, but you’re going
            to like me more.”
          </p>
          <p>
            While it may seem a bit manipulative, that kind of glad-handing
            doesn’t actually hurt anyone, and it’s what may be necessary to get
            ahead. It may require a reorganisation of priorities for those who’d
            rather focus on their to-do list over socialising. But going against
            that instinct can be beneficial. It’s all part of career
            maintenance, which Frohlinger says is every worker’s responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you don’t take care of your career,” she says, “nobody else is
            going to do it.”
